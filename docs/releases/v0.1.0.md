# VAOL v0.1.0 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-19

## Overview

Initial public release of the Verifiable AI Output Ledger — a cryptographically verifiable, append-only ledger for AI/LLM inference decisions targeting regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal, government).

## Core Features

### Cryptographic Evidence Pipeline
- **DSSE Envelopes** — Every DecisionRecord is signed using Dead Simple Signing Envelopes with PAE (Pre-Authentication Encoding).
- **Three Signing Backends** — Ed25519 (local PEM keys), Sigstore keyless (Fulcio certificates + Rekor anchoring), KMS/HSM (ECDSA P-256 via AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, PKCS#11).
- **SHA-256 Hash Chaining** — Each record links to its predecessor via `previous_record_hash`, forming a tamper-evident chain.
- **RFC 6962 Merkle Tree** — Append-only log with verifiable inclusion proofs, consistency proofs, and signed checkpoints.
- **JCS Canonicalization** — RFC 8785 deterministic JSON serialization ensures hash stability across platforms.

### Privacy Modes
- `hash_only` (default) — Only SHA-256 digests stored; proves integrity without exposing content.
- `encrypted` — age X25519 encrypted blobs; content recoverable with key.
- `plaintext` — Full content for internal audit; requires explicit policy allow.

### Policy-as-Code
- OPA/Rego policy engine with fail-closed semantics.
- Five example policies included: base validation, deny plaintext, model allowlist, PHI redaction, mandatory citations.
- Policy decisions, bundle versions, and rule IDs sealed into every record.

### Verification
- Four-layer composite verification: signature, schema, hash chain, Merkle inclusion.
- Configurable profiles: basic, strict, FIPS.
- Standalone CLI and API verification — no server access needed for offline bundle verification.

### Authentication
- JWT/OIDC verification with HS256, RS256, ES256.
- Tenant and subject claim binding.
- Three modes: disabled (development), optional, required (production default).

## Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `vaol-server` | REST API ledger server |
| `vaol` (CLI) | Command-line tool for init, keys, verify, inspect, export |
| `vaol-proxy` | OpenAI-compatible transparent proxy |
| `vaol` (Python SDK) | Client, record builder, `instrument_openai()` wrapper |
| `@vaol/sdk` (TypeScript) | Client, record builder, `instrumentOpenAI()` wrapper |

## Deployment Options

- **Docker Compose** — Local development with server, proxy, PostgreSQL, OPA.
- **Helm Chart** — Kubernetes with production profile (required auth, fail-closed policy, strict Sigstore).
- **Binary** — Single-binary distribution for all platforms.

## Testing

- 13 Go test packages passing with race detector.
- Dedicated tamper detection regression suite.
- End-to-end lifecycle tests and proxy integration tests.
- Reproducible auditor demo script (`scripts/demo_auditor.sh`).

## Breaking Notes from RC1

No breaking changes from v0.1.0-rc1. All rc1 behavior is preserved in the final release.

## Verification Steps

```bash
# Build from source
make build

# Run full test suite
go test -race ./...

# Run auditor demo
./scripts/demo_auditor.sh

# Start local stack
make docker-up
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/health
```
